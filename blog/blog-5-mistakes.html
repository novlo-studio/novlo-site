                    <h2>1. Building a Website Without a Clear Goal</h2>
                    <p>One of the biggest mistakes businesses make is starting with design instead of purpose.</p>
                    <p>Before thinking about colors, layouts, or animations, you should be able to answer one simple question:</p>
                    <blockquote>What do you want visitors to do on your website?</blockquote>
                    <p>Is it to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Book a consultation?</li>
                        <li>Send an inquiry?</li>
                        <li>Buy a product?</li>
                        <li>Trust your brand enough to contact you?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When a website tries to do everything, it usually does nothing well. A clear goal guides every decision — from page structure to copywriting to call-to-action placement.</p>
                    
                    <div class="how-to-avoid">
                        <h4>How to avoid it:</h4>
                        <p>Define one primary action for each page. If a visitor only spends 10 seconds on your site, what is the one thing they should understand or do?</p>
                    </div>
                </section>

                <section class="article-point">
                    <h2>2. Treating the Website Like a Digital Flyer</h2>
                    <p>Many business owners see their website as an online brochure — a place to list services, prices, and contact information.</p>
                    <p>But a website is not just something people <em>look at</em>. It's something people <strong>interact with</strong>.</p>
                    <p>A static site that only talks about you misses the opportunity to guide visitors, answer their concerns, and build trust step by step.</p>
                    
                    <div class="how-to-avoid">
                        <h4>How to avoid it:</h4>
                        <p>Shift the focus from "What we do" to "What you get." Use your website to walk visitors through a story:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Who this is for</li>
                            <li>What problem you solve</li>
                            <li>Why your approach is different</li>
                            <li>What they should do next</li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                </section>

                <section class="article-point">
                    <h2>3. Ignoring the First 5 Seconds</h2>
                    <p>Most visitors decide whether to stay or leave within 5 seconds.</p>
                    <p>If your hero section is vague, cluttered, or overly generic, people won't scroll — no matter how good the rest of the site is.</p>
                    <p>Common issues include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unclear headlines</li>
                        <li>Stock photos with no meaning</li>
                        <li>Too much text above the fold</li>
                        <li>No obvious next step</li>
                    </ul>

                        <h4>How to avoid it:</h4>
                        <p>Your top section should instantly answer:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What is this business?</li>
                            <li>Who is it for?</li>
                            <li>Why should I care?</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2>4. Overdesigning Instead of Communicating</h2>
                    <p>Animations, effects, and trendy layouts can look impressive — but only if they support the message.</p>
                    <p>I often see websites that are visually polished but emotionally empty. They look good, but they don't say anything.</p>
                    <p>Design should amplify communication, not compete with it.</p>
                    
                    <div class="how-to-avoid">
                        <h4>How to avoid it:</h4>
                        <p>Use design as a tool, not a decoration.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>White space improves readability</li>
                            <li>Consistent layouts build trust</li>
                            <li>Simple visuals keep users focused</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If something looks cool but doesn't help users understand or decide, it probably doesn't belong there.</p>

                    <h2>5. Forgetting About Maintenance and Growth</h2>
                    <p>A website is not a one-time project.</p>
                    <p>Businesses change. Services evolve. Brand positioning shifts.</p>
                    <p>Websites that aren't built with flexibility in mind quickly become outdated, inaccurate, or abandoned altogether.</p>

                        <h4>How to avoid it:</h4>
                        <p>Plan for updates from the start.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Make content easy to edit</li>
                            <li>Leave room for blogs, case studies, or new services</li>
                            <li>Think long-term, not just launch day</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A good website grows with your business — it doesn't freeze it in time.</p>

                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                    <p>A successful business website isn't about being flashy or complex. It's about being <strong>clear, intentional, and user-focused</strong>.</p>
                    <p>If you avoid these common mistakes, your website stops being "just a site" and starts working as a real business tool — building trust, generating leads, and supporting growth.</p>
